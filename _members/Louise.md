Dr. Louise Ince completed her BSc in Cognitive Neuroscience & Psychology, MRes in Integrative Biology and PhD in Neuroscience at the University of Manchester, UK. She performed her dissertation research under the supervision of Prof. Andrew Loudon, Prof. David Ray and Prof. Julie Gibbs, working on rhythmic glucocorticoid signaling & neutrophil migration to the lung after inflammatory challenge. 

She then joined the [Scheiermann lab](https://www.scheiermannlab.de/) as a post-doc, where she studied the influence of biological rhythms upon adaptive immune function, including temporal variation in dendritic cell trafficking and modulation of vaccination efficacy. 

Now a Research Associate in the [Fonken lab](https://www.fonkenlab.com/), Louise is using her expertise in rhythmic immunology to investigate how changes in neuroimmune rhythms contribute to cognitive decline in aging and dementia.
