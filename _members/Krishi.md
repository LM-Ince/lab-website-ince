Krishi is a senior majoring in Neuroscience in the Deanâ€™s Scholars Honors Program. 

Krishi is assessing circadian rhythms in periphery-central nervous system immune crosstalk in the context of aging: using confocal microscopy to quantify microglia and assess their morphology, and developing whole mount immunostaining of meninges.

Outside of research and academics, he likes to explore Austin, exercise, and enjoy the food scene with his friends.
