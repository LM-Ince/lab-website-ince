Anusha Dabak is a junior majoring in Neuroscience in the Polymathic Scholars honors program. 

Anusha is characterizing a new mouse line lacking the core clock element Bmal1 specifically in microglia: using PCR to determine genotype, IHC to assess protein levels, and behavioral analyses to determine the impact of microglial clock disruption in these animals.

Outside of research, she enjoys painting, running, baking/cooking, and hiking.
