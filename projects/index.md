I aim to understand the interactions between the circadian and immune systems, with the goal of using rhythmic immunity to improve health. My research is driven by the central questions:

<div class="centered-questions">
  <ol>
    <li>How do circadian rhythms regulate inflammation?</li>
    <li>What are the consequences of circadian disruption on immune function?</li>
  </ol>
</div>
   
The immune system has a critical biological function, governing an organismâ€™s interaction with the environment and its ultimate survival. Immune function is also highly rhythmic: there are daily patterns of immune cell migration and in immune cell reactivity to stimuli (e.g., production of inflammatory cytokines, uptake of antigens). Inflammation is a common component in the etiology of many diseases, but our immune system can also be used to our advantage in fighting cancer and infections. Thus, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms regulating immune function will facilitate development of both restorative and preventative therapies.

I am particularly interested in how immune function and circadian immunity changes in the context of aging, and the potential for circadian-based strategies to boost immune health.
